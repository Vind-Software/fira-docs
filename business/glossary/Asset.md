An `asset` represents an element that belongs to one or more `users` and provide value to them. The ownership of `assets` follow the `general rule of ownership`. All `Assets` have an accquisition date and a non-negative original value. An `asset` value can be calculated at any point in time after its accquisition date by summing all of its `transactions` prior to the reference date. An asset also has a `liquidity`, that express how fast its value can be used for `transference transactions`.

## Asset Types
There are several types of `assets` that can compose the `patrimony` of an user. The type of an asset describes its behaviour on regards to `liquidity`, `taxes` and more. Here is a description of each:
- Realizable Assets: Assets that can be realized into cash. After their acquisition, their values can only change through `appreciation` and `depreciation` transactions. To access its value in other types of transactions, first a `sell transaction` must be done. Realizable assets are NOT tied to a currency, only their `buy` and `sell` transactions are.  
- Monetary Assets: represents a sum of cash, right away available for transactions. They are tied to a currency.
