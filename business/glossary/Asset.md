An `asset` represents an element that belongs to one or more `users` and provide value to them. The ownership of `assets` follow the `general rule of ownership`. All `Assets` have an accquisition date and a non-negative original value. An `asset` value can be calculated at any point in time after is accquisition date by summing all of its `transactions` prior to the reference date. An asset also has a `liquidity`, that express how fast its value can be used for `transference transactions`.
