An `liability` represents an obligation that the `user(s)` that owns it must resolve. Similar to `Assets`, `liabilities` have a acquisition date and a initial value. `Transactions` can be made to an `liability` either reducing or increasing its value. The value of a `liability` can be calculated at any moment in time through the sum of its initial value and all transactions up to the reference date. The `liability` value contributes negatively to the portfolio value. The ownership of `liabilities` follow the `general rule of ownership`.
